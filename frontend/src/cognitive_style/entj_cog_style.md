🧠 Cognitive Function Stack (in order of dominance)
Extraverted Thinking (Te) – Dominant

Introverted Intuition (Ni) – Auxiliary

Extraverted Sensing (Se) – Tertiary

Introverted Feeling (Fi) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Extraverted Thinking (Te) — "What gets results and moves things forward?"
Te makes ENTJs decisive, organized, and focused on measurable impact.

They quickly assess systems and implement efficient solutions to meet goals.

Te drives them to optimize, lead, and make logical decisions—they value clarity, action, and effectiveness.

They tend to cut through fluff and expect competence in others.

Keywords: strategy, execution, logic, outcomes, systems thinking, no-nonsense leadership

2. Introverted Intuition (Ni) — "What long-term vision is unfolding beneath the surface?"
Ni gives ENTJs a singular sense of focus and direction over time.

It allows them to synthesize complex inputs into clear insights and long-term goals.

This intuitive layer helps them see beyond the present moment, forecast consequences, and rally others around a big vision.

Keywords: insight, foresight, clarity of direction, abstract integration, strategic thinking

3. Extraverted Sensing (Se) — "What's happening right now and how do I act on it?"
Se allows ENTJs to stay grounded in real-world data and respond to opportunities decisively.

It supports their ability to act quickly, take calculated risks, and be dynamic in the moment.

It also makes them visually or experientially sharp, though this is more supportive than core.

Keywords: sensory sharpness, real-time awareness, action orientation, responsiveness

4. Introverted Feeling (Fi) — "Does this align with my personal values?"
Fi is the least conscious function and can be underdeveloped or private in ENTJs.

They may struggle with processing their own emotions or tuning into inner ethical nuance.

However, mature ENTJs develop a quiet but strong sense of integrity and justice—not easily influenced by trends or sentiment.

Keywords: internal moral compass, private emotion, loyalty to principles, tension with vulnerability
