🧠 Cognitive Function Stack (in order of dominance)
Introverted Feeling (Fi) – Dominant

Extraverted Intuition (Ne) – Auxiliary

Introverted Sensing (Si) – Tertiary

Extraverted Thinking (Te) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Introverted Feeling (Fi) — “What’s true to my deepest values?”
Fi is personal, ethical, and deeply reflective.

INFPs use this function to evaluate experiences based on inner alignment, authenticity, and moral truth.

They often appear quiet or gentle externally, but carry a strong, unwavering internal compass.

They prioritize emotional integrity over external harmony.

Keywords: authenticity, identity, values, inner conviction, self-exploration, emotional clarity

2. Extraverted Intuition (Ne) — “What possibilities or meanings could this hold?”
Ne provides a rich imagination and an ability to see symbolic connections and future potential.

It complements Fi by helping INFPs explore new ideas, meanings, and creative expressions of their inner world.

This gives them a poetic, hopeful, and often spiritually open-ended tone.

Keywords: imagination, possibility, insight, metaphor, symbolism, curiosity

3. Introverted Sensing (Si) — “How does this align with what I’ve experienced or known?”
Si brings memory and internalized experience into reflection.

For INFPs, it shows up as nostalgia, ritual comfort, or emotional memory that subtly guides decisions.

While not dominant, it offers familiarity and depth when navigating change.

Keywords: memory, rhythm, inner stability, tradition (in a personal sense), emotional timelines

4. Extraverted Thinking (Te) — “How can I make this actionable or structured?”
Te is the least natural for INFPs, often underdeveloped unless intentionally strengthened.

They may resist rigid systems or external expectations, but under pressure can rely on Te to “get things done” — though often at the cost of stress or burnout.

When matured, Te helps them bring vision to life practically.

Keywords: efficiency (under stress), planning fatigue, results pressure, tension with deadlines

🧭 Cognitive Summary
Axis	INFP Trait	Description
I	Introverted	Internally reflective, values depth over volume
N	Intuitive	Focused on abstract meaning, spiritual growth, and future potential
F	Feeling	Makes decisions based on internal ethics and personal resonance
P	Perceiving	Open-ended, flexible, values freedom and natural unfolding over strict structure

🧩 How INFPs Tend to Process Spiritual or Reflective Questions
Prefer gentle, emotionally resonant prompts that feel safe and open-ended

Love reflection that explores identity, meaning, purpose, and connection with God’s heart

Avoid “checkbox” spirituality — they want something deeply authentic, not formulaic

Tend to connect with poetic, symbolic, or imaginative spiritual language

May take time to answer — they process inwardly and need space to unfold
