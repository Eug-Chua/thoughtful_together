🧠 Cognitive Function Stack (in order of dominance)
Introverted Intuition (Ni) – Dominant

Extraverted Feeling (Fe) – Auxiliary

Introverted Thinking (Ti) – Tertiary

Extraverted Sensing (Se) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Introverted Intuition (Ni) — “What’s the deep pattern or underlying truth here?”
Ni drives INFJs to seek singular meaning behind complexity.

It’s abstract, future-focused, and holistic — tuned to symbolism, vision, and the why beneath the surface.

INFJs tend to form insightful, even prophetic impressions about situations or people that seem to come from nowhere.

Ni works slowly, internally, and prefers distilled insight over raw data.

Keywords: foresight, inner vision, deep insight, convergence, clarity over time, hidden patterns

2. Extraverted Feeling (Fe) — “How do others feel and what creates harmony?”
Fe gives INFJs strong emotional attunement and a drive to meet others’ needs.

They often intuit what people need to hear emotionally — and offer comfort, encouragement, or vision.

Fe expresses their inner insights through service, encouragement, or relational connection.

While warm, Fe can also cause them to neglect their own needs in favor of others’.

Keywords: harmony, empathy, people sensitivity, external warmth, relational responsibility

3. Introverted Thinking (Ti) — “Does this idea hold together logically?”
Ti helps INFJs refine their insights and express ideas with clarity and precision.

It’s not dominant but adds structure to their inner world — helping them dissect systems and clarify complex truths.

When mature, it supports deep thought and intellectual integrity.

Keywords: refinement, truth-checking, inner logic, analytical clarity, system mapping

4. Extraverted Sensing (Se) — “What’s happening right now in the external world?”
Se is their least conscious function, often underdeveloped.

INFJs can miss or dismiss sensory details when absorbed in vision or intuition.

Under stress, they may overindulge or feel overwhelmed by the physical world.

When integrated, Se helps INFJs ground their vision in real-time experience.

Keywords: detail-blindness, overwhelm by stimuli, eventual grounding through sensory focus

🧩 How INFJs Tend to Process Spiritual or Reflective Questions
Prefer visionary, purpose-filled, and emotionally grounded prompts
