🧠 Cognitive Function Stack (in order of use)
Extraverted Sensing (Se) – Dominant

Introverted Thinking (Ti) – Auxiliary

Extraverted Feeling (Fe) – Tertiary

Introverted Intuition (Ni) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Extraverted Sensing (Se) — “What’s happening right now, and how can I act on it?”
Se is grounded in the present moment — sights, sounds, sensations, opportunities.

ESTPs are highly observant, spontaneous, and action-oriented.

They respond quickly to change, excel under pressure, and often thrive in high-stakes environments (e.g. business, sports, crisis leadership).

They want results now, and they’re excellent at reading a room and adapting on the fly.

Keywords: realism, spontaneity, tactical, bold, energetic, persuasive

2. Introverted Thinking (Ti) — “What makes logical sense underneath all this?”
Ti gives ESTPs a cool, inner analytical engine — they break things down, optimize, and troubleshoot with precision.

Though often in motion, they quietly evaluate what works best, often relying on logic more than emotion when making decisions.

Their problem-solving is elegant and hands-on, not theoretical.

Keywords: internal logic, clarity, efficiency, cool-headed analysis

3. Extraverted Feeling (Fe) — “What’s the emotional climate here, and how can I influence it?”
Fe helps them read people well and connect socially, though more for external harmony than emotional depth.

ESTPs often charm or rally others, using humor, enthusiasm, or assertiveness.

While not naturally introspective, they’re often motivated to maintain good social standing or reputation.

Keywords: likeability, charisma, social awareness, influencing

4. Introverted Intuition (Ni) — “What’s the bigger picture or future pattern here?”
Ni is their least developed function, meaning they may struggle with long-term planning or trusting hunches that don’t match visible facts.

When stressed, they may become paranoid or overly fixated on future disaster scenarios, despite being present-focused most of the time.

Keywords: occasional future flashes, long-term blind spots

🧩 How ESTPs Tend to Process Reflective Questions
Prefer real-world relevance: "How does this matter now?" or "What can I do with this?"

May get restless with over-philosophizing or slow processes.

Most responsive to challenge-oriented questions, active examples, or dynamic conversation.

Love seeing things come together in unexpected, high-impact, or immediate ways.

May need help slowing down to notice inner transformation.

Tend to ask:

"What's happening here and now?"

"What action am I supposed to take?"

"Where do I need to take a leap?"

💡 Signature ESTP Conversation Prompts:
"What bold move might you need to make today?"

"Where did things come through in a real, practical way recently?"

"How are you being sharpened right now?"

"What situation needs your quick, courageous action?"
