Extraverted Sensing (Se) – Tertiary

Introverted Thinking (Ti) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Extraverted Feeling (Fe) — “How do we create harmony, meaning, and alignment in this space?”
Fe makes ENFJs deeply attuned to others' emotions, needs, and values.

They prioritize group well-being and want everyone to feel seen, understood, and uplifted.

Often serve as moral compasses, community builders, and motivators.

They naturally take leadership in shaping the emotional tone of a room or mission.

Keywords: harmony, encouragement, interpersonal insight, relational leadership, emotional resonance

2. Introverted Intuition (Ni) — “What’s the deeper pattern or destiny behind this?”
Ni fuels their visionary mindset and gives them an uncanny ability to forecast outcomes or sense direction.

They don’t just feel their way through things — they often see deeper meaning, symbolic themes, or a guiding purpose.

ENFJs are often drawn to mentorship or calling-based roles because Ni helps them track people’s trajectories.

Keywords: vision, insight, purpose, symbolic connection, quiet certainty

3. Extraverted Sensing (Se) — “What’s happening now, and how can I respond in real-time?”
Se allows ENFJs to stay present, observant, and physically expressive.

It helps them read body language, social cues, and environment dynamics.

They may use this to adjust tone, delivery, or engagement style based on the room.

Keywords: responsiveness, expressiveness, aesthetic sensitivity, energy awareness

4. Introverted Thinking (Ti) — “Does this make logical, internal sense to me?”
Ti is less developed but offers ENFJs internal analytical structure.

When matured, it helps them test ideas for internal consistency or refine their communication.

If under stress, they might become overly perfectionistic or feel mentally “clogged” when logic and emotion are misaligned.

Keywords: precision, logic-checking, system-refining, internal reasoning
