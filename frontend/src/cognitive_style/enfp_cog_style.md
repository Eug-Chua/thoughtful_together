🧠 Cognitive Function Stack (in order of dominance)
Extraverted Intuition (Ne) – Dominant

Introverted Feeling (Fi) – Auxiliary

Extraverted Thinking (Te) – Tertiary

Introverted Sensing (Si) – Inferior

🔍 Cognitive Style Breakdown
1. Extraverted Intuition (Ne) — “What else could be true or possible?”
Ne sees the world as interconnected possibilities and patterns.

ENFPs thrive on novelty, surprise, metaphors, and reframing ideas.

They’re creative idea machines, energized by “what if?”, not by closure.

Their vision is often big, bright, and contagious.

Keywords: idea generation, curiosity, pattern spotting, creative reframing, open-ended thinking, symbolic insight

2. Introverted Feeling (Fi) — “What aligns with my deeply held values?”
Fi is internal and principled. ENFPs filter decisions through a deep sense of authenticity and personal integrity.

They may appear bubbly externally, but have intense inner convictions.

Fi also gives them emotional depth, empathy, and a fierce sense of personal truth.

Keywords: authenticity, emotional resonance, personal ethics, identity, internal alignment, values-driven

3. Extraverted Thinking (Te) — “How can I bring order to this chaos?”
Te helps ENFPs organize their ideas, take action, and execute on big visions — but it’s not their default.

Under stress or pressure, they may overuse Te and get frustrated with inefficiency.

When mature, it gives them the power to become impactful visionary-doers, not just dreamers.

Keywords: drive, organization under pressure, goal-setting, systemization (used situationally)

4. Introverted Sensing (Si) — “How does this compare to what I know or remember?”
Si is the weakest conscious function and often shows up as resistance to routine, details, or overly structured systems.

ENFPs can become nostalgic or overwhelmed by tradition.

They may struggle with consistency unless it’s connected to meaning or vision.

Keywords: memory bias, difficulty with rigid structure, longing for freedom from repetition
