# Thoughtful Together
A year-end reflection tool that tailors questions to your personality type.

## What it does
Guides you through reflecting on your year and what's ahead.

Pick Casual (lighter) or Deep (heavier), and the questions adjust based on your MBTI and Enneagram.

## Why personality matters here
We kept running into the same problem with other reflection tools: 100 generic questions that feel like homework. You get three in and zone out.

Turns out an INTJ and an ENFP need pretty different prompts to get to the same place. The INTJ wants to analyze patterns; the ENFP wants to talk about what moved them. Ask them the same question and one of them checks out.

So the questions reframe based on how your personality type. Same themes, different framing.

## Features
Two modes: Casual and Deep
Questions adapt to MBTI + Enneagram
GPT-4o does the reframing

Works for year-end gatherings, one-on-ones, or just you with a journal.
