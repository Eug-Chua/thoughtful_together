# Thoughtful Together
A conversation tool that helps strangers and friends connect beyond small talk.

## What it does
Gives you questions that help people open up and actually get to know each other.

Pick Casual (lighter) or Deep (heavier), and the questions adjust based on your MBTI and Enneagram.

## Why personality matters here
Generic icebreakers get generic answers. "What do you do?" leads to the same surface-level exchange every time.

Turns out an INTJ and an ENFP need different prompts to open up. The INTJ wants to discuss ideas and patterns; the ENFP wants to share what moved them. Ask them the same question and one of them gives you a rehearsed answer.

So the questions reframe based on personality type. Same intent, different framing—so everyone actually engages.
